# Hello-Developers

Hey guys!

I'm very new in the Tech world. I hope to become a Junior Web Develeper next year around this time. I've acquired a little knowledge thus far on JavaScript, as I started with 'Introduction to Programming' but had to drop the module this past semester. However, I'm excited to start again next semester! I will appreciate all the help I can get from you, and to pointed in the right direction for success.
